# GhostRacer

Ghost racer is a fast-paced arcade style game in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies (who have unfortunately also learned how to drive). As the main character, you are driving a car down the Los Angeles Freeway. It is your goal to collect lost Souls while eliminating Zombies with your Holy Water Spray, avoiding pedestrians, and dealing with Zombie Cabs trying to run you off the road.

To run the game, download the zip file https://github.com/nashif99/GhostRacer/blob/main/GhostRacer.zip, extract all, and run the executable. On Windows, you may get a privacy warning, you will have to click "Run Anyway".
